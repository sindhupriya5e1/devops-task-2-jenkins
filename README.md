🔄 CI/CD Workflow
The complete workflow is:

1. Developer Push
The developer makes changes to the application and pushes them to the GitHub main branch.

2. GitHub Webhook
GitHub sends a webhook notification to Jenkins when a change is pushed.

3. Jenkins Checkout
Jenkins retrieves the latest source code from the GitHub repository.

4. Build
Jenkins installs the required Node.js dependencies.

npm install
5. Test
Jenkins executes the automated application tests.

npm test
6. Docker Build
Jenkins creates a Docker image.

docker build -t jenkins-cicd-task2:latest .
7. Deploy
Jenkins stops and removes the previous container and starts a new container.

docker stop jenkins-cicd-task2-container || true
docker rm jenkins-cicd-task2-container || true
docker run -d \
  --name jenkins-cicd-task2-container \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  jenkins-cicd-task2:latest
8. Application Verification
The application becomes available on port 3000.

🧩 Jenkins Pipeline Stages
The Jenkinsfile contains the following stages.

Stage 1 — Checkout
Retrieves source code from GitHub.

stage('Checkout') {
    steps {
        echo 'Checking out source code from GitHub...'
        checkout scm
    }
}
Purpose
This stage ensures that Jenkins works with the latest version of the source code.

Stage 2 — Build
Installs the Node.js application dependencies.

stage('Build') {
    steps {
        echo 'Installing application dependencies...'
        sh 'npm install'
    }
}
Purpose
Downloads and installs the packages defined in package.json.

Stage 3 — Test
Runs the application's automated tests.

stage('Test') {
    steps {
        echo 'Running application tests...'
        sh 'npm test'
    }
}
Purpose
Testing prevents defective code from moving further into the deployment process.

Stage 4 — Docker Build
Creates the Docker image.

stage('Docker Build') {
    steps {
        echo 'Building Docker image...'
        sh 'docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME}:latest .'
    }
}
Purpose
Packages the application and its runtime environment into a portable Docker image.

Stage 5 — Deploy
Deploys the Docker container.

stage('Deploy') {
    steps {
        echo 'Deploying application...'
        sh '''
            docker stop ${CONTAINER_NAME} || true
            docker rm ${CONTAINER_NAME} || true
            docker run -d \
                --name ${CONTAINER_NAME} \
                -p 3000:3000 \
                ${IMAGE_NAME}:latest
        '''
    }
}
Purpose
Ensures that the latest Docker image is running as the deployed application.

📝 Jenkinsfile
The project uses a declarative Jenkins Pipeline.

pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        IMAGE_NAME = 'jenkins-cicd-task2'
        CONTAINER_NAME = 'jenkins-cicd-task2-container'
    }

    stages {

        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                echo 'Checking out source code from GitHub...'
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Installing application dependencies...'
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running application tests...'
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }

        stage('Docker Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building Docker image...'
                sh 'docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME}:latest .'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying application...'
                sh '''
                    docker stop ${CONTAINER_NAME} || true
                    docker rm ${CONTAINER_NAME} || true
                    docker run -d \
                        --name ${CONTAINER_NAME} \
                        -p 3000:3000 \
                        ${IMAGE_NAME}:latest
                '''
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'CI/CD Pipeline completed successfully!'
        }

        failure {
            echo 'CI/CD Pipeline failed. Check the console output.'
        }
    }
}
🐳 Docker Configuration
The application is containerized using Docker.

Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install --omit=dev

COPY app.js ./

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "app.js"]
Dockerfile Explanation
Instruction	Purpose
FROM node:18-alpine	Uses a lightweight Node.js image
WORKDIR /app	Sets the application working directory
COPY package*.json ./	Copies package files
RUN npm install --omit=dev	Installs production dependencies
COPY app.js ./	Copies application source code
EXPOSE 3000	Documents application port
CMD	Starts the application
🌐 Application Endpoints
The application provides two endpoints.

🔗 GitHub Integration
The Jenkins pipeline is connected to the GitHub repository:

https://github.com/sindhupriya5e1/devops-task-2-jenkins
Jenkins is configured to use:

Branch: main
Script Path: Jenkinsfile
The pipeline uses Pipeline script from SCM, which means Jenkins retrieves the Jenkinsfile directly from the GitHub repository.

🔔 GitHub Webhook
A GitHub Webhook is configured to notify Jenkins whenever code is pushed to the repository.

Webhook endpoint:

http://<JENKINS-SERVER>:8080/github-webhook/
The webhook is configured for:

Push events

🔐 Security Considerations
For a production environment, the following practices should be followed:

Never commit passwords or API tokens to GitHub.
Never expose GitHub Personal Access Tokens in screenshots.
Store Jenkins credentials using Jenkins Credentials Manager.
Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive CI/CD values.
Restrict cloud security-group rules.
Avoid exposing Jenkins publicly without proper authentication and network controls.
Use HTTPS for production services.
Use non-root containers where appropriate.
Regularly update Jenkins, Docker, Node.js, and dependencies.

Jenkins
Jenkins is an automation server used to implement CI/CD pipelines.

In this project Jenkins performs:

Source Checkout
Dependency Installation
Testing
Docker Build
Deployment
Docker
Docker packages applications into containers.

A container provides a consistent environment for running the application.

GitHub Webhook
A webhook allows GitHub to send an HTTP request to Jenkins when an event occurs, such as a code push.

Jenkinsfile
A Jenkinsfile stores the CI/CD pipeline definition as code.

Advantages:

Version controlled
Reproducible
Easy to review
Easy to maintain
Stored together with application source code
💡 Why CI/CD Is Important
Without CI/CD:

Developer
   ↓
Manual Build
   ↓
Manual Testing
   ↓
Manual Deployment
With CI/CD:

Developer
   ↓
Git Push
   ↓
Automated Pipeline
   ↓
Build
   ↓
Test
   ↓
Docker Build
   ↓
Deployment
CI/CD reduces repetitive manual work and provides faster feedback on software changes.

❓ Interview Questions
1. What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source automation server commonly used to automate software development processes such as building, testing, and deploying applications.

2. What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment.

It automates the process of integrating code changes, testing applications, and delivering or deploying software.

3. What is a Jenkinsfile?
A Jenkinsfile is a text file that defines a Jenkins pipeline as code.

4. Why use Pipeline as Code?
It allows the pipeline configuration to be version-controlled together with the application source code.

5. What is a GitHub Webhook?
A GitHub Webhook sends event notifications from GitHub to another service such as Jenkins.

6. Why is Docker used in this project?
Docker packages the application and its runtime dependencies into a container, making deployment more consistent.

7. What happens if the test stage fails?
The pipeline stops progressing to later stages unless the pipeline is explicitly configured to continue.

8. What is the purpose of docker build?
It creates a Docker image from the instructions defined in the Dockerfile.

9. What is the purpose of docker run?
It creates and starts a container from a Docker image.

10. What is the difference between an image and a container?
A Docker image is a packaged template used to create containers.

A container is a running instance of a Docker image.

🚀 Future Improvements
The project can be extended with:

Docker Hub image publishing
