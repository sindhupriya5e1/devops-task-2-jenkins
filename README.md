# 🔄 CI/CD Workflow

The complete workflow is:

### 1. Developer Push

The developer makes changes to the application and pushes them to the GitHub `main` branch.

### 2. GitHub Webhook

GitHub sends a webhook notification to Jenkins when a change is pushed.

### 3. Jenkins Checkout

Jenkins retrieves the latest source code from the GitHub repository.

### 4. Build

Jenkins installs the required Node.js dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Test

Jenkins executes the automated application tests.

```bash
npm test
```

### 6. Docker Build

Jenkins creates a Docker image.

```bash
docker build -t jenkins-cicd-task2:latest .
```

### 7. Deploy

Jenkins stops and removes the previous container and starts a new container.

```bash
docker stop jenkins-cicd-task2-container || true
docker rm jenkins-cicd-task2-container || true

docker run -d \
  --name jenkins-cicd-task2-container \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  jenkins-cicd-task2:latest
```

### 8. Application Verification

The application becomes available on port `3000`.

# 🧩 Jenkins Pipeline Stages

The Jenkinsfile contains the following stages.

## Stage 1 — Checkout

Retrieves source code from GitHub.

```groovy
stage('Checkout') {
    steps {
        echo 'Checking out source code from GitHub...'
        checkout scm
    }
}
```

### Purpose

This stage ensures that Jenkins works with the latest version of the source code.

---

## Stage 2 — Build

Installs the Node.js application dependencies.

```groovy
stage('Build') {
    steps {
        echo 'Installing application dependencies...'
        sh 'npm install'
    }
}
```

### Purpose

Downloads and installs the packages defined in `package.json`.

---

## Stage 3 — Test

Runs the application's automated tests.

```groovy
stage('Test') {
    steps {
        echo 'Running application tests...'
        sh 'npm test'
    }
}
```

### Purpose

Testing prevents defective code from moving further into the deployment process.

---

## Stage 4 — Docker Build

Creates the Docker image.

```groovy
stage('Docker Build') {
    steps {
        echo 'Building Docker image...'
        sh 'docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME}:latest .'
    }
}
```

### Purpose

Packages the application and its runtime environment into a portable Docker image.

---

## Stage 5 — Deploy

Deploys the Docker container.

```groovy
stage('Deploy') {
    steps {
        echo 'Deploying application...'
        sh '''
            docker stop ${CONTAINER_NAME} || true
            docker rm ${CONTAINER_NAME} || true
            docker run -d \
                --name ${CONTAINER_NAME} \
                -p 3000:3000 \
                ${IMAGE_NAME}:latest
        '''
    }
}
```

### Purpose

Ensures that the latest Docker image is running as the deployed application.

---

                echo 'Checking out source code from GitHub...'
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Installing application dependencies...'
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running application tests...'
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }

        stage('Docker Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building Docker image...'
                sh 'docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME}:latest .'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying application...'
                sh '''
                    docker stop ${CONTAINER_NAME} || true
                    docker rm ${CONTAINER_NAME} || true
                    docker run -d \
                        --name ${CONTAINER_NAME} \
                        -p 3000:3000 \
                        ${IMAGE_NAME}:latest
                '''
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'CI/CD Pipeline completed successfully!'
        }

        failure {
            echo 'CI/CD Pipeline failed. Check the console output.'
        }

# 🔐 Security Considerations

For a production environment, the following practices should be followed:

* Never commit passwords or API tokens to GitHub.
* Never expose GitHub Personal Access Tokens in screenshots.
* Store Jenkins credentials using Jenkins Credentials Manager.
* Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive CI/CD values.
* Restrict cloud security-group rules.
* Avoid exposing Jenkins publicly without proper authentication and network controls.
* Use HTTPS for production services.
* Use non-root containers where appropriate.
* Regularly update Jenkins, Docker, Node.js, and dependencies.

Manual Deployment
```

With CI/CD:

```text
Developer
   ↓
Git Push
   ↓
Automated Pipeline
   ↓
Build
   ↓
Test
   ↓
Docker Build
   ↓
Deployment
```

CI/CD reduces repetitive manual work and provides faster feedback on software changes.
